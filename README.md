# A4770 Cheetah

A modern successor to the A4091 / A4092.

All the goodness of the A4092:
* TSSOP parts for smaller footprint
* SPI Flash instead of parallel EPROM
* CPLD instead of GALs
* Autoconfig moved into CPLD

And also:
* Update to NCR53c770 SCSI Host Controller
* Ultra-Wide SCSI support
* Drop unneeded ferrites and capacitors on SCSI lines
* Replace DIP-switch mechanism entirely w/ Software/Logic
* No more resistor arrays

# THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT BUILD. FEEDBACK IS WELCOME
